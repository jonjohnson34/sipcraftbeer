>An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. – Ernest Hemingway

Every year for the past twelve years, a group of my friend and I take a yearly pilgrimage up to Northern Arizona to come together and share all the beers we have been collecting over the previous year, along with massive amounts of poker playing. There are six of us so the beer selection is varied and vast, and we always seem to go home with some leftover beer. 

Since we done this for so long I thought I would gather my thoughts on the rules you should abide by when having a beer gathering of your own. 

**Rule One - It really isn't about the beer**
    The first rule is that any gathering centered around beer, or anything else, isn't really about the beer it is about hanging out with friends. The range of beer that was brought to our event is varied in style and quality, some of the beers we had tasted many times over and are group favorites and some were first time beers for everyone. It comes down to the fact that we do this to hang out together without anyone else stealing our time, the cabin we go to is outside of cell phone range and has no internet connection we get to hang out and just be together in the moment. We all have jobs and families and our times together are not as frequent as they were in our younger year, so we all look forward to this weekend. 

**Rule Two - It is kind of about the beer** 
    Okay this is really more like rule 1b, yes hanging out with the guys is important for everyone. But having good beer is important as well, this is a craft beer post after all. We make sure we bring beers that a majority of the group will enjoy drinking (or at least tasting). Not everyone in my group likes all styles, one of us won't touch most IPAs (which is getting though in this current craft beer world obsessed with hops). While a different friend is an all out hophead and wants all the IPAs. Since everyone brings there own beers, we end up with a pretty good selection that is likely to keep even the most picky craft beer drinker happy. We are usually together from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, which is a long time to be drinking a lot of Russian Imperial Stouts or Double IPAs, we make sure that we have enough different types of beers to 'switch it up' through out the weekend. This year our range of beers went from Moosehead Lager (we have a couple of Canadians in the group) all the way to a 2017 bottle of The Bruery's Black Tuesday. 

**Rule Three - Timing is everything** 
    We spend the whole weekend together and go though a lot of beer, but we don't all want to be passed out by 3pm in the afternoon. We tend to follow some patterns, while we are playing cornhole (or bags if you prefer), or just hanging outside in general we stick with the low abv lighter beers: saisons, table beers, light lagers, etc. As the day progresses the styles of beers change we start to bring out the stouts and sours, along with the double ipa and belgians. We also try to not do a lot of the same style in a row if we had opened several sours we will break out a stout, or if we have open a few stouts we will break them up with a dank IPA.

**Rule Four - Don't have too many beer open at one time** 
    Three max is our rule, if we end up with more beers then that open at the same time there is a chance that one might get missed and not drank, which might lead to it being dumped, no one wants to be the guy who has to dump a rum barrel aged quad down the drain because it got opened and was still full the next morning. We don't have a minimum we generally stick to, two beers of different styles is usually what we have open at any one time so that the whole group is able to have something they want to taste or drink. 

**Rule Four exception - Vertical Tastings**
    There is one exception that we do allow to break rule for, but this doesn't happen every year. If you want to compare the same style of beers from different breweries, this year we did this with several imperial stouts we had and did a small judging of them. In the past we have done this with other beer styles as well, but we try to not do it that often and enjoy the beers as we drink them.   

**Rule Five - It is okay if you don't get though all the beers**
    Not everything has to be consumed, most of the beers we bring were already hanging out in a beer cellar and they can always go back there for next time. I personally always bring too much beer so that I can help switch up styles when needed, but I also bring multiples of the same beer to make sure we all get to taste it (really only applicable for 12oz cans). This generally leads to most of us taking home beer that we didn't get to drink while we were together. As I type this I am enjoying a King Sue Double IPA from Toppling Goliath that we only drank one of the 3 cans of it I brought. Yeah me!

**Rule Six - Sharing is caring**
    In conjunction with rule number five, if you don't get through the beers you brought and have extra before you pack it up and go home, use this time to trade for the beers you like but didn't bring. This year I was able to trade an extra Pseudo Sue IPA for an Untitled.Art chocolate stout. The group that gets together also lives in different areas of the state (we are all no longer in the Phoenix metro area), so some of them don't have full access to Phoenix beers, we help each other out as well and a couple of us brought up a bunch of different Wren House beers at the request of one of the group, and at the end of the trip were able to slip those into his cooler for later enjoyment. 


If you made it this far, thank you for reading. As a note, these are just rules that my friends and I like to abide by even if they aren't officially written down (yet, maybe I will turn this into a book someday). Feel free to adjust to meet the needs and likes of you and your group of friends. 

Prost!
