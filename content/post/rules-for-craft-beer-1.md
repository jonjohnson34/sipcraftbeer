>An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. – Ernest Hemingway

This past weekend my friends and I gathered for a yearly weekend event that we have gathered together for the last twelve years. This year had to make some changes to standard craft beer itinerary in order to keep all of us safe, but we also needed to spend some time outside now that the brutal summer heat of Arizona had finally subsided. 

The gist of this yearly pilgrimage up to Northern arizona is to come together and share all the beers we have been collecting over the previous year, along with massive amounts of poker playing and trash talking. There are six of us that do this so the beer selection is varied and vast, we always seem to go home with some leftover beer. 

Since we done this for so long I thought I would gather my thoughts on the rules you should abide by when having a beer gathering of your own. 


**Rule One - It really isn't about the beer**
    The first rule is that any gathering centered around beer, or anything else, isn't really about the beer it is about hanging out and being with friends. The range of beer that was brought to our event is varied in style and quality, some of the beers we had tasted many times over and are group favorites and some were first time beers for the group. It comes down to the fact that we do this to hang out together without any this else stealing our time, the cabin we go to is outside of cell phone range and has no internet connection so we get to hang out and just be there in the moment. We all have jobs and families and our times together are not as frequent as they were in years past, so we all look forward to this weekend whenever it comes along. 

**Rule Two - It is kind of about the beer** 
    This is more like rule 1b, yes hanging out with the guys is important for everyone. But having good beer is important as well, this is a craft beer blog after all. So we make sure we bring something that a majority of the group will enjoy drinking (or at least tasting). Not everyone in my group likes all styles, one of us won't touch most IPAs (which is getting though in this current craft beer world obsessed with hops). While a different friend is an all out hop head and wants all the IPAs. Since everyone brings there own beers, we end up with a pretty good selection that is likely to keep even the most picky craft beer drinker happy with the selection. The last thought I have blends nicely with Rule Three bwlow, we are usually together from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, which is a long time to be drinking a lot of Russian Imperial Stouts or Double IPAs, so we make sure that we have enough different types of beer to 'switch it up' through out the weekend. To get a sense of this our range of beers went from Moosehead Lager (we have a couple of Canadians in the group) all the way to a 2017 bottle of The Bruery's Black Tuesday. 

**Rule Three - Timing is everything** 
    We spend the whole weekend together and go though a lot of beer, but we don't want to all be passed out by 3pm in the afternoon. So we tend to follow some patterns, while we are playing cornhole (or bags if you prefer), or just hanging outside in general we stick with the low abv lighter beers: saisons, table beers, light lagers, etc. As the day progresses the style of beers start to change we start to bring out the stouts and sours, along with the double ipa and belgians. We also try to not do to many of the same style in a row if we had opened several sours we will break out a stout, or if we have open a lot of stouts we will break them up with a dank IPA.

**Rule Four - Don't have too many beer open at one time** 
    Three max is our rule, if we end up with more beers then that there is a chance that one might get missed and not drank, which might lead to it being dumped, no one wants to be the guy who has to dump a rum barrel aged quad down the drain because it got opened and was still full the next morning. We don't have a minimum we generally stick to, two of different styles it usually what we have open at any one time so that the whole group is able to have something they want to taste or drink. As an example, we have some non-IPA likers so if we open an IPA we generally have a different style open for them. 

**Rule Four exception - Vertical Tastings**
    There is one exception that we do allow to break rule four, but doesn't happen every year. If you want to compare the same style of beers from different breweries, in this case we did this with a several imperial stouts we had and wanted to do a small judging of them. In the past we have done this with other beer styles as well, but we try to not do it that often and enjoy the beers as we drink them. Also, sometime it doesn't work out that we have brought beers of similar styles and hype that we want to compare.  

**Rule Five - It is okay if you don't get though all the beers**
    Not everything has to be consumed, most of the beers we bring were hanging out in a beer cellar anyways and they can always go back there for next time. I personally always bring too much beer so that I can help switch up styles when needed, but I also bring multiples of the same beer to make sure we all get to taste it (really only applicable for 12oz cans). This generally leads to most of us taking home beer that we didn't get to drink while we were together. As I type this I am enjoying a King Sue Double IPA from Toppling Goliath that we only drank one of the 3 cans of it I brought. Yeah me!

**Rule Six - Sharing is caring**
    In conjunction with rule number five, if you don't get through the beers you brought and have extra before you pack it up and go home, use this time to trade for the beers you like but didn't bring. This year I was able to trade an extra Pseudo Sue IPA for an Untitled.Art chocolate stout. This group that gets together also lives in different areas of the state these days (we are all no longer in the Phoenix metro area), so some of them don't have full access to Phoenix beers, we help each other out as well and a couple of us brought up a bunch of different Wren House beers at the request of one of the group, and at the end of the trip were able to slip those into his cooler for later enjoyment. 


If you made it this far, thank you for reading. As a note, these are just rules that my friends and I like to abide by even if they aren't officially written down (yet, maybe I will turn this into a book someday). Feel free to adjust to meet the needs and likes of you and your group of friends. Prost!
