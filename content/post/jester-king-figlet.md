If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about a couple of very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX. 

I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall. Those are not the times I have been there, the last time I was there was in December right after Christmas, on the bright side I didn't need to bring a cooler to keep my to-go beers cool on the way to where I was staying.

The first thing you notice when pouring this beer, is the color, a deep amber that is reminisce of the perfectly worn in cowboy boots on a steel guitar picker sitting behind post office in Luckenbach, TX (Pop. 3). While the color of the beer is amazing the smell and taste are what make this beer stand out. At the basic level this beer is a collaboration with the pitmaster Aaron Franklin and his legendary smokers at Franklin BBQ. Aaron was gifted some Texas figs and he smoked them and returned them to Jester King to finish the beer. 

As soon as you smell this beer you get the whiff of oak smoke that was used, but it doesn't push forward into the taste of the beer. Once you start to sip it you get the sweetness of those figs. But where this beer gets a chance to really shine is after letting it warm up to close to room temperature where the initial sweetness subsides and in comes some serious carmel and vanilla flavors that the figs picked up from the smoking process, if you closed your eyes you would almost think you were sipping on some good old fashion Texas bourbon (Rebecca Creek is my personal favorite) minus the 100 proof burn.

While drinking this beer at the brewery is an experience that I recommend for every fan of craft beers. The best place to drink is after you buy in Austin, drive west on 290 pull over and find a tall oak tree and pull out a blanket. Pull out some fatty slices of brisket and some jalapeno cheese sausage and crack a Figlet open and watch the sun down.
