>Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each. — Henry David Thoreau

I love drinking beers based on the season, but what do you do when your 'seasons' don't match up with not only the rest of the world, but don't align with the beer release calendar either. 

I live somewhere in the mass metropolis of Phoenix, AZ and we don't really get the normal four seasons that most of the rest of the county gets which make trying to drink seasonally a little challenging at times. I mean, who wants to have to have a bourbon barrel aged pumpkin stout on Oct 31st when it is 100 degrees outside. 

If I had it my way I would like to drink like this.

- **Spring** - Saison, IPA, Kolsch, Pilsners

I love Spring beers, fresh hops, light refreshing styles as the weather starts to get warmer and you start to do more outside. Fishing season kicking off. 

- **Summer** - Wheat beers, Session beers, Belgian blondes

In the summer you spend a lot of time outside, so you needs beers that are going to quench your thrust and refresh you while spending all day on the golf course, or hiking many miles. 

- **Fall** - Oktoberfest beers, Porters, Dubbel, Quads, Wet Hop IPAs

The temp starts to drop so the beers start to get darker, fireplaces and fire pits are starting to get fired up in the last days before the first snowfall and you start to stay inside. 

- **Winter** - Big ABV beers, Stouts, Barleywines, Double IPAs

Snow is on the ground, temperatures hover around the same ABV that these beer are. The sun lowers sooner ever night and fires move inside. Making these sippers the perfect beers to keep you warm while you dream of the grass starting to grow and you can crack open those spring beers once again. 


Here is how I have to drink now.
- **Summer** - Pretty much the same, drink light lagers, saisons, wheat beers. I just have to stock up on them in the early months so that I still have some lighter beers in the September early Oct. range when it is still warm here. 
- **Not Summer** - Try and buy the fall beers I love when they come out in the Aug. and Sept. range so that when the temps do drop in late Oct. (hopefully) or Nov. I have them as beer stores are already pushing the winter stouts and ales in which I try to save them so that I have them available in Jan. and Feb.

What can you do if you want to embrace the season but the weather doesn't match up, here is what I try to tell myself. Hopefully you can find a sliver of inspiration to help yourself out as well. 

1. Don't worry about it drink what you like when you want to. Nobody has to drink like I do, I have friends who are all one style and nothing else, so trying to line up beer styles to the season just isn't there way.    
2. Quit complaining, the distribution of craft beer is more far reaching then it ever has been and that most styles of beers are generally available year round. Most beer do keep there freshness long enough to make sure that I can enjoy them when I want to without sacrificing too much of the beers peak taste. 
3. Realize that IPAs are taking over the world, and that seasonal release beers just aren't there as much. This one probably should be a post of it own. I know that the craft beer consumers tastes are a moving target for most breweries. But, the amount of IPAs that are getting brewed at this moment is kind of overwhelming. I love a well balanced IPA as much as the next craft beer lover, but I like to not burn out my taste buds on hops as well, and this is getting harder and harder every passing seasonal cycle.
