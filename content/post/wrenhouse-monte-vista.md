> “Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.” -Paul Tillich

If you follow me on Instagram you noticed that I was reading The Great Alone: Walking the Pacific Coast Trail, it is a fantastic book by Tim Voors (Van Go) about his six month adventure hiking from Mexico all the way to Canada on the PCT. I highly recommend it, it is a quick easy ready as he effortlessly writes you through his experience, and it is his experience highlighting both the highs and the lows. Living here is Phoenix about this time of year mid to late Sept one generally starts to get a little cabin fever after about the 100th day of the temperature being above 100 degrees (among other reasons in the current state of this country).

So with a spring style Saison from a the local brewery Wrenhouse, and this book, I was almost a new man with a much better outlook on my current situation. Monte Vista from Wrenhouse is a classic saison in all facets of the beer. When you pour it a perfect golden ale with a creamy white foamy head end us within your glass. The aroma is that perfect yeasty bready smell that you want from a classic saison. Nothing has been added to this beer so again it is just pure saison as soon as it hits your tongue. All in all this beer is a saison and they don't have anything added to hide behind so all you get a great local beer that is also a great example of a classic saison. 

As I sat here this Sunday evening reading and savouring this saison alone (but not by myself the rest of the house is in bed), you can't help but reflect on the ideas and themes that I have been reading about, the biggest one is on being alone. The amount of time that Tim spends alone during his hike is pretty obvious, as it is 2650 miles from border to border, and I can't help but think about when I drove from Wisconsin moving down to Arizona I covered 1800ish miles in a car mostly alone, with a friend flying into El Paso to meet me and drive with me the last day (just as Tim finds makes new friends on the trail and sometimes decides to hike with them). Now my thoughts didn't go as deep as Tim's thoughts about family about God and about himself, I at the time was much younger and so my thoughts were around starting a new chapter in my life where the safety net of having family close by was gone. I didn't have a job lined up at the time so I was starting fresh. I though a lot about failure, what if I didn't find a job, could I make that drive back to Wisconsin, should I make that drive. That chapter of my life thankfully ended up with a pretty good ending but not without plenty of failures. As I start to take this journey to write more and put it out there for the world to read and consume, I sit here alone still thinking about failure (and the saison it really is good), what if no one reads this, what if I get bored, what if I get tired of drinking beer (just kidding). Now you may be asking if I learned anything about failure, and I would answer absolutely! 99% of all failures are temporary, as long as it doesn't lead to death, the failure will be gone at some point after having failed. So how much should you think about failure, my opinion is to learn just enough to know how not to fail in that same way again, that's it, after pour another beer and move on to the next adventure. 

~ Prost!
