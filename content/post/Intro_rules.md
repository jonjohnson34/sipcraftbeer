What this blog will be about

1. There is occasion for every beer, and a beer for every occasion
- Macro beers are okay as well as craft
- Don't pick the wrong beer
- 

2. Great..Good...Everything else
- jonathan gold method of talking about beers that are good. 
- Never talk bad about beer (even bad beers take a lot of work by people to make)

3. Taste is just the entry point, how does the beer make you feel (reference Grant)
- Taste is for pussy's 
- so many other places that people tell you how the beer tastes 
- i want to know how the beer makes you feel when you drink it
- 

4. Terroir is just as relevant for beer as it is for other beverages 
- where the ingredients in your beer should matter as much as the grapes matter in wine
- how does the final product change with the way, methods, and conditions that the ingredients were grown 
- the same beer being different in different years shouldn't be considered a bad thing
