If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about several very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX. 

I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall. Those are not the times I have been there, the last time I was there was in December right after Christmas, on the bright side I didn't need to bring a cooler to keep my to-go beers cool on the way back to where I was staying.

The first thing you notice when pouring this beer, is the color, a deep amber that is reminisce of the perfectly worn in cowboy boots on a steel guitar picker sitting behind post office in Luckenbach, TX (Pop. 3). While the color of the beer is amazing the smell and taste are what make this beer stand out. At the basic level this beer is a collaboration with the pitmaster Aaron Franklin and his legendary smokers at Franklin BBQ. Aaron was gifted some Texas figs and he smoked them and returned them to Jester King to finish the beer. 

As soon as you smell this beer you get the whiff of oak smoke that was used, but it doesn't push forward into the taste of the beer. Once you start to sip it you get the sweetness of those figs. But where this beer gets a chance to really shine is after letting it warm up to close to room temperature where the initial sweetness subsides and in comes some serious carmel and vanilla flavors that the figs picked up from the smoking process, if you closed your eyes you would almost think you were sipping on some good old fashion Texas bourbon (Rebecca Creek is my personal favorite) minus the 100 proof burn.

While drinking this beer at the brewery is an experience that I recommend for every fan of craft beers. The best place to drink this beer is after you buy one (or three) in Austin, drive southwest of the brewery deeper into the hill country find any BBQ place (Bonus points if you come across Salt Lick BBQ which is pretty close but be warned it's cash only and BYOB so you can bring your Jester King with you and drink it) order some of the fatty side of the brisket, a couple of jalapeno cheese sausage links and pour the beer into what cups you can find as Figlet will pair perfectly with them and ride out the sunset to whatever house honkey tonk band is playing and dance the two step to work off the BBQ calories.
