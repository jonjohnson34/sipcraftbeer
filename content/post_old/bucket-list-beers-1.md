> "The first thing on my bucket list is to fill the bucket with beer" - Unknown to the Author

Everyone should have a bucket list, a list that has the adventure or experiences that a person feels compelled to accomplish before ones short time on this earth has completed. While I do have a list of places and experiences that I would like to do, I also keep a list of beers that I would like to taste/drink/consume in mass quantities before I decide that my life with beer has run its course. This will probably be an ongoing series of post, as my list is long and ever changing as I find and drink these beer in my travels. So we will start with just 5 of them, and this is in no particular order. 

1. **Heady Topper - The Alchemist** - The top of the East Coast IPA food chain this America Double IPA is probably been on a lot of peoples beer bucket list. Me not having had this beer yet it mostly because the New England area of America is not a place I have made the effort to travel to yet (it's a long way from the west coast), hint: you will see a pattern forming. 

Comparable Beer that I have had: **Pliny the Elder** - The West Coast Double IPA that probably has as many fans as Heady Topper.

2. **Hills Farmstead Beers - Any Beer that they make** - Again being on the west coast and a sucker for a good wild yeast, brett, or spontaneous fermentation Hills Farmstead beers have been really high on my list to try and to visit the farm in Vermont. 

Comparable Beer that I have had: **Jester King** - Along with Hills, one of the OG of farmhouse beers in America, also on a huge acreage farm that has started it's own farm along with death metal goat yoga. 

3. **Dark Lord Stout - 3 Floyds** - A once a year release for the brewery in Indiana this Russian Imperial Stout was my first intro into the knowledge that breweries brew beers that aren't there all year long. I have been lucky enough to have several of there other beers in travels back to the Midwest, shout-out to Gumballhead one of my favorite all time beers. I have never been in the area on the release day. 

Comparable Beer that I have had: **Surly Darkness** - I am lucky enough to have a brother-in-law in the Twin Cities (who also happens to like craft beer) so I don't have to stand in line, and somehow a bottle finds its way into my refrigerator every year. 

4. **Utopia - Sam Adams** - This was my first introduction into really extreme and really rare beers while it is not the biggest ABV beer out there, that would fall on the Scottish Brewery Brewmeister's Snake Venom at a whopping 65.7%. But this one is also very limited and so there is a great chance that I will spend the rest of my days chasing this white whale. 

Comparable Beer that I have had: **N/A** I have had a lot of high ABV beers and a lot of really rare ones. But never anything that I would think about comparing to Utopia. 

5. **Treehouse Brewery - Any beer that they make** - If I had to choose just one I would probably pick Green, but this Massachusetts brewery know for their amazing IPAs (among other great beers) gets shuffled into the pack of New England breweries/beers that you just have to be in the region to find and taste. 

Comparable Beer that I have had: **Modern Times** - A comparable west coast brewery that also makes world class IPAs (among other great beers), although I am able to find a lot of their beers and so I also enjoy a lot of their beers.
