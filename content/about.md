Welcome to Sip Craft Beer! If you got this far congrats you have entered my little part of internet
where I plan on written mostly about craft beer, which is where most of my adventures end up leading me towards.
It may get a little weird around here as well, so just remember you have been warned.  

They say that good craft will allow you to remember the time and place that you enjoyed them, and that a great beer will also taste better is you share it will others. I share a lot of great beer around the country as I try and find good beers where ever my travels take me. 

Hopefully you find some enjoyment reading about craft beer and the places I go to get it.
