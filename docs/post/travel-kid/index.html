<p>“Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you.” - Anthony Bourdain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as I have been on this earth I have traveled across the country (and into a few other countries as well), it started with my family moving several times in my childhood. Moved on to tagging along with my dad on his weekly sales trips during the summer (don&rsquo;t skip school kids!) across most of the central time zone and various south and southwestern states. After driving to a new home all the way from north to south across the country. To now taking trips to music festivals in other states, or just driving up from the valley into the mountains to get my Jeep back into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>I truly believe the travel bug is hereditary if my father hadn&rsquo;t wandered the world then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have this nervous tick when I sit at home and day dream about the next time I can hit the road and end up someplace new. These days I don&rsquo;t get out on the road as much as I did when I was younger which is not a huge surprise. When the tethers of life start to pull on you, youthful freedom makes way for the permanence that comes with old age. Like the seeds of dandelions that are carried across the land by the whims of the wind, but rooted to the spot as soon as they find a life under the soil.</p>
<p>And so here I am in between trips left to ponder why I still love being on the road, in the air, or just thinking what trip I am going to take the next time I can. My family would travel during the summer in a big suburban across vast amounts of land, which allowed my brother and I an unique experience traversing the country in the back. The single best experience when traveling for me is driving just right after the sun is set knowing that you are almost to the next city and there is always that one last corner or one last hill that as soon as you come around it or over it, BANG, the lights of whatever new city you where entering spread across the horizon like it was a city that never slept or never ended. Sprawling there with all the unknown of what it was or could be, my mind spinning at the possibilities. When I was young they all seemed like big cities, some where, like driving into Kansas City or Minneapolis, some weren&rsquo;t, like St. Joesph, MO or Souix Falls, SD. But, they were all new at that moment, even if that was the fifth time we had stayed in that city on our way somewhere else or the actual first time we had driven into that city.</p>
<p>I hope that sometime soon, that you get to pass me in the dark on some highway sailing into some city or town for the first time or just heading home for the thousandth time cause I will be slowing down in the left lane trying to catch those city lights in a jar like the first fireflies of the summer so I can find a place to rest and awaken to being somewhere new and all the possibilities that live in new towns, even if it is just the possibility to move on to the next one.</p>
<p>&ndash; Cheers!</p>
