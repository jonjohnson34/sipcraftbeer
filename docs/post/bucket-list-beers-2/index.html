<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been everywhere but it&rsquo;s on my list&rdquo; - Paolo Coelho</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part 2 of my bucket list beers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blackberry Farms</strong> - This kind of goes along with the Hills Farmstead (and the Trillium below), farmhouse brews are kind of my thing. While I enjoy all beers the idea of the beer having that terroir from the farm and the products that are possibly grown there is the beer experience is where my love of craft beer came from in the first place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Blackberry Farms - Saison</strong> - So let me explain. I have had the Saison (one bottle) in Denver so while it was an amazing Saison it was hard to say that I have had the beer since it wasn&rsquo;t in TN on the farm so I don&rsquo;t feel like I really had this beer, so on the list it stays (for now).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pliny The Younger</strong> - I have had other Russian River beers (Pliny the Elder, Blind Pig IPA, etc.), but I have never made the pilgrimage to Santa Rosa in Feb to sample The Younger. I will admit this is getting closer and will probably end up being the one that gets crossed off the list sooner, as Russian River is starting to bottle these on a yearly basis when it is released.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>LOL</strong> I got nothing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Trillium Brewing</strong> - An east coast MA brewery that focus on many styles of beer, but I am most intrigued by the plethora of wild yeast ales that they bottle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Prairie Artisan Ales</strong> The Oklahoma brewery who does many great styles of beer (Hello the Bomb Stouts line of beers), but who I focus my drinking on the wild/sour ales that they produce.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Brewery Vivant</strong> - A Michigan brewery that brews in the style of Belgian monks and European farmhouse beers. Like most of us I was introduced to them from the collaboration Bier de Garde they did with New Belgium out of Fort Collins, CO. Since that beer came out I have had them on my list to try. They are also a well struck 3 wood away from Founders Brewery so the whole of Grand Rapids, MI is a stop any craft beer road trip deserves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Lost Abby</strong> - Absolutely one of my all time favorite breweries. They also focus on European style/Belgian Monk beers. Also in a city that every craft beer connoisseur should be visiting regularly San Diego, CA.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Toppling Goliath - Kentucky Brunch</strong> - Now I drank a lot of TG beers in my life, as I write this I have a 4 pack of Psuedo Sue and King Sue IPA&rsquo;s in my fridge and have sampled several others from this Iowa brewery, but I haven&rsquo;t been close enough to stand in line in order to sample the #1 rated beer according to Beeradvocate.com and I don&rsquo;t know that I ever will.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout</strong> - Now this isn&rsquo;t a one to one comparison but I do really love Founders CBS, and am sad that they are possible no longer going to be brewing it moving forward. This is really a wish and/or a wild dream that like other hard in the past to find stouts, one can also add Goose Island Bourbon County Stout to this list, TG decides to ramp up production and increase the availability of this beer so that one doesn&rsquo;t have to stand in line in a little corner of Iowa to taste what I imagine is a wonderful stout.</p>
