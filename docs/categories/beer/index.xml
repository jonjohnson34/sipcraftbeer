      <description>Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each. — Henry David Thoreau
 I love drinking beers based on the season, but what do you do when your &amp;lsquo;seasons&amp;rsquo; don&amp;rsquo;t match up with not only the rest of the world, but don&amp;rsquo;t align with the beer release calendar either.
I live somewhere in the mass metropolis of Phoenix, AZ and we don&amp;rsquo;t really get the normal four seasons that most of the rest of the county gets which make trying to drink seasonally a little challenging at times.</description>

      <description>An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. – Ernest Hemingway
 This past weekend my friends and I gathered for a yearly weekend event that we have gathered together for the last twelve years. This year had to make some changes to standard craft beer itinerary in order to keep all of us safe, but we also needed to spend some time outside now that the brutal summer heat of Arizona had finally subsided.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been everywhere but it&amp;rsquo;s on my list&amp;rdquo; - Paolo Coelho
 This is part 2 of my bucket list beers.
 Blackberry Farms - This kind of goes along with the Hills Farmstead (and the Trillium below), farmhouse brews are kind of my thing. While I enjoy all beers the idea of the beer having that terroir from the farm and the products that are possibly grown there is the beer experience is where my love of craft beer came from in the first place.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The first thing on my bucket list is to fill the bucket with beer&amp;rdquo; - Unknown to the Author
 Everyone should have a bucket list, a list that has the adventure or experiences that a person feels compelled to accomplish before ones short time on this earth has completed. While I do have a list of places and experiences that I would like to do, I also keep a list of beers that I would like to taste/drink/consume in mass quantities before I decide that my life with beer has run its course.</description>

      <description>“Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.” -Paul Tillich
 If you follow me on Instagram you noticed that I was reading The Great Alone: Walking the Pacific Crest Trail, it is a fantastic book by Tim Voors (Van Go) about his six month adventure hiking from Mexico all the way to Canada on the PCT. I highly recommend it, it is a quick easy ready as he effortlessly writes you through his experience, and it is his experience highlighting both the highs and the lows.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a 106 miles to Chicago, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes; it&amp;rsquo;s dark and we&amp;rsquo;re wearing sunglasses. Hit it!&amp;rdquo; - Elwood &amp;amp; Joliet Jake, The Blues Brothers
 I spent my college years in the Second City well before craft beer took over the city, at the time the only one that was there was Goose Island (the OG). The craft breweries that sprouted inside the city have made me really jealous of the current class of college students (and all the other people in general as well) who get to wander the city drinking a plethora of great craft beer.</description>

      <description>Beer’s intellectual. What a shame so many idiots drink it. ~Ray Bradbury
 As a born midwesterner I have a affinity to the beers of the region. My first taste of craft beer was a honey labeled beer out of Chippewa Falls, WI, and while it is no longer an independent brewery any more that doesn&amp;rsquo;t lessen the importance of the beer to my life. While I no longer live in the midwest and so I don&amp;rsquo;t get a normal fall anymore 1 but that means that I get to cling onto the summer beers that I enjoy even longer.</description>

      <description>Northern Arizona&amp;hellip; surrounded by a fragrant piney forest under a peaceful turquoise sky&amp;hellip; what a perfect retreat, he thought, from the pace and pressure of modern living. ~Paul Harvey, &amp;ldquo;The Ghost and Don Dedera,&amp;rdquo; December 1972
 There is a reason the can is as blue as the sky above it, and the hops balance effortlessly between piney and citrusy. It all comes down to the magic that exists in one of a very few places where beer meets world.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There is a freedom you feel the closer you get to Austin, Texas.&amp;rdquo; - Willie Nelson
 If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about a couple of very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX.
I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall.</description>
