<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 106 miles to Chicago, we&rsquo;ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes; it&rsquo;s dark and we&rsquo;re wearing sunglasses. Hit it!&rdquo; - Elwood &amp; Joliet Jake, The Blues Brothers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spent my college years in the Second City well before craft beer took over the city, at the time the only one that was there was Goose Island (the OG). The craft breweries that sprouted inside the city have made me really jealous of the current class of college students (and all the other people in general as well) who get to wander the city drinking a plethora of great craft beer.</p>
<p>Now since I am far removed from the Chicago area, and living here in Phoenix (hey you don&rsquo;t have to shovel sunshine) even though it is late September where leaves in the other parts of the country are turing shades of some of my favorite beers, here not so much. So while the wonderful fall beers start showing up on shelves it always feels a little misleading to be drinking them when is 98 degrees outside. But, as you can tell I don&rsquo;t let get in the way I just turn up the air conditioner to re-create the crisp fall evening that those beers require. I decided to turn my attentions and taste buds to a German Lager like Half Acre&rsquo;s Lager Town Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>The first thing that you notice when you pour it is the copper color that this style demands, a color reminiscent of a shiny Lincoln penny, that gives way to a foamy white head that sits on top like a bed of pillowy spaetzle next to your weinersnitchel.</p>
<p>The aroma that comes off this beer after you pour it is what you want sitting next to the fire on a crisp evening surrounded by friends, it packs a balance between the sweetness of the caramel malts and the don&rsquo;t forget that we are here noble hops that make this style of beer one of my favorites</p>
<p>After a summer of fruited sours and light beers to stave off the heat lounging in the pool, this beer is a reminder that it is not summer anymore and brings all the fall notes when you first take a sip of it, the hint of molasses and caramel apples brings forth the message that is time to venture to the fire pit and wear big sweaters while racking leaves for kids and dogs to jump into. As you continue to sip this beer the sweetness of the beer slowly fades as the maltiness of the style starts to march forward like the band of your alma mater on a friday night, lending to notes of fresh baked coming right out of the oven.</p>
<p>I would happily drink this beer with a large plate of hand made German sausage as the sweetness of this Marzen is a great combo to cut through the fattiness of the meats. Yet, this beer could easily stand alone as a break from the summer beers that have populated shelves for several months bridging the gap between those and the stouts, porters, and dark beers that are coming down the road.</p>
<p>~ Prost!</p>
