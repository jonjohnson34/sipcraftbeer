<p>&ldquo;The first thing on my bucket list is to fill the bucket with beer&rdquo; - Unknown to the Author</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone should have a bucket list, a list that has the adventure or experiences that a person feels compelled to accomplish before ones short time on this earth has completed. While I do have a list of places and experiences that I would like to do, I also keep a list of beers that I would like to taste/drink/consume in mass quantities before I decide that my life with beer has run its course. This will probably be an ongoing series of post, as my list is long and ever changing as I find and drink these beer in my travels. So we will start with just 5 of them, and this is in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heady Topper - The Alchemist</strong> - The top of the East Coast IPA food chain this America Double IPA is probably been on a lot of peoples beer bucket list. Me not having had this beer yet it mostly because the New England area of America is not a place I have made the effort to travel to yet (it&rsquo;s a long way from the west coast), hint: you will see a pattern forming.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Pliny the Elder</strong> - The West Coast Double IPA that probably has as many fans as Heady Topper.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Hills Farmstead Beers - Any Beer that they make</strong> - Again being on the west coast and a sucker for a good wild yeast, brett, or spontaneous fermentation Hills Farmstead beers have been really high on my list to try and to visit the farm in Vermont.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Jester King</strong> - Along with Hills, one of the OG of farmhouse beers in America, also on a huge acreage farm that has started it&rsquo;s own farm along with death metal goat yoga.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Dark Lord Stout - 3 Floyds</strong> - A once a year release for the brewery in Indiana this Russian Imperial Stout was my first intro into the knowledge that breweries brew beers that aren&rsquo;t there all year long. I have been lucky enough to have several of there other beers in travels back to the Midwest, shout-out to Gumballhead one of my favorite all time beers. I have never been in the area on the release day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Surly Darkness</strong> - I am lucky enough to have a brother-in-law in the Twin Cities (who also happens to like craft beer) so I don&rsquo;t have to stand in line, and somehow a bottle finds its way into my refrigerator every year.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Utopia - Sam Adams</strong> - This was my first introduction into really extreme and really rare beers while it is not the biggest ABV beer out there, that would fall on the Scottish Brewery Brewmeister&rsquo;s Snake Venom at a whopping 65.7%. But this one is also very limited and so there is a great chance that I will spend the rest of my days chasing this white whale.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>N/A</strong> I have had a lot of high ABV beers and a lot of really rare ones. But never anything that I would think about comparing to Utopia.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Treehouse Brewery - Any beer that they make</strong> - If I had to choose just one I would probably pick Green, but this Massachusetts brewery know for their amazing IPAs (among other great beers) gets shuffled into the pack of New England breweries/beers that you just have to be in the region to find and taste.</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparable Beer that I have had: <strong>Modern Times</strong> - A comparable west coast brewery that also makes world class IPAs (among other great beers), although I am able to find a lot of their beers and so I also enjoy a lot of their beers.</p>
