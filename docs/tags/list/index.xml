      <description>Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each. â€” Henry David Thoreau
 I love drinking beers based on the season, but what do you do when your &amp;lsquo;seasons&amp;rsquo; don&amp;rsquo;t match up with not only the rest of the world, but don&amp;rsquo;t align with the beer release calendar either.
I live somewhere in the mass metropolis of Phoenix, AZ and we don&amp;rsquo;t really get the normal four seasons that most of the rest of the county gets which make trying to drink seasonally a little challenging at times.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been everywhere but it&amp;rsquo;s on my list&amp;rdquo; - Paolo Coelho
 This is part 2 of my bucket list beers.
 Blackberry Farms - This kind of goes along with the Hills Farmstead (and the Trillium below), farmhouse brews are kind of my thing. While I enjoy all beers the idea of the beer having that terroir from the farm and the products that are possibly grown there is the beer experience is where my love of craft beer came from in the first place.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The first thing on my bucket list is to fill the bucket with beer&amp;rdquo; - Unknown to the Author
 Everyone should have a bucket list, a list that has the adventure or experiences that a person feels compelled to accomplish before ones short time on this earth has completed. While I do have a list of places and experiences that I would like to do, I also keep a list of beers that I would like to taste/drink/consume in mass quantities before I decide that my life with beer has run its course.</description>
