      <description>&amp;ldquo;The first thing on my bucket list is to fill the bucket with beer&amp;rdquo; - Unknown to the Author
 Everyone should have a bucket list, a list that has the adventure or experiences that a person feels compelled to accomplish before ones short time on this earth has completed. While I do have a list of places and experiences that I would like to do, I also keep a list of beers that I would like to taste/drink/consume in mass quantities before I decide that my life with beer has run its course.</description>
