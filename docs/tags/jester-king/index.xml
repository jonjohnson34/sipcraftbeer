      <description>If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about a couple of very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX.
I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall. Those are not the times I have been there, the last time I was there was in December right after Christmas, on the bright side I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to bring a cooler to keep my to-go beers cool on the way to where I was staying.</description>
