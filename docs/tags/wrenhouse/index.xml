      <description>“Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.” -Paul Tillich
 If you follow me on Instagram you noticed that I was reading The Great Alone: Walking the Pacific Coast Trail, it is a fantastic book by Tim Voors (Van Go) about his six month adventure hiking from Mexico all the way to Canada on the PCT. I highly recommend it, it is a quick easy ready as he effortlessly writes you through his experience, and it is his experience highlighting both the highs and the lows.</description>
