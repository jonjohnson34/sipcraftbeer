      <description>Welcome to Sip Craft Beer! If you got this far congrats you have entered my little part of internet where I plan on written mostly about craft beer, which is where most of my adventures end up leading me towards. It may get a little weird around here as well, so just remember you have been warned.
They say that good craft will allow you to remember the time and place that you enjoyed them, and that a great beer will also taste better is you share it will others.</description>

      <description>If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about a couple of very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX.
I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall. Those are not the times I have been there, the last time I was there was in December right after Christmas, on the bright side I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to bring a cooler to keep my to-go beers cool on the way to where I was staying.</description>
