      <description>Beerâ€™s intellectual. What a shame so many idiots drink it. ~Ray Bradbury
 As a born midwesterner I have a affinity to the beers of the region. My first taste of craft beer was a honey labeled beer out of Chippewa Falls, WI, and while it is no longer an independent brewery any more that doesn&amp;rsquo;t lessen the importance of the beer to my life. While I no longer live in the midwest and so I don&amp;rsquo;t get a normal fall anymore 1 but that means that I get to cling onto the summer beers that I enjoy even longer.</description>

      <description>Northern Arizona&amp;hellip; surrounded by a fragrant piney forest under a peaceful turquoise sky&amp;hellip; what a perfect retreat, he thought, from the pace and pressure of modern living. ~Paul Harvey, &amp;ldquo;The Ghost and Don Dedera,&amp;rdquo; December 1972
 There is a reason the can is as blue as the sky above it, and the hops balance effortlessly between piney and citrusy. It all comes down to the magic that exists in one of a very few places where beer meets world.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Sip Craft Beer! If you got this far congrats you have entered my little part of internet where I plan on writing mostly about craft beer, which is where most of my adventures end up leading me towards. It may get a little weird around here as well, so just remember you have been warned.
They say that good craft will allow you to remember the time and place that you enjoyed them, and that a great beer will also taste better is you share it will others.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There is a freedom you feel the closer you get to Austin, Texas.&amp;rdquo; - Willie Nelson
 If you have been to Texas Hill Country you hopefully learned about a couple of very important things, wide open spaces, the best BBQ in the world (yes, the world), and a little farmhouse just outside of Austin, TX.
I have been fortunate enough to have been to the brewery several times and it is highly recommended when the weather is nice in the spring or fall.</description>
